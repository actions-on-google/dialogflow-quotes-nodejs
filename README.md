# Actions on Google: Developer Relations Quotes sample using Node.js and Cloud Functions for Firebase

This sample shows an app for the Google Assistant using Actions on Google that provides the user with a random quote from a Developer Relations Googler by fetching data via an HTTP request to an external URL.

## Setup Instructions

### Steps

**Note: This sample uses Firebase Cloud Functions to make an HTTP request to a non-Google service. The free Firebase Spark Plan only allows outbound network calls to Google services. If you plan to run the sample, you will need to temporarily [upgrade to a Firebase plan that allows for outbound networking](https://firebase.google.com/pricing), such as the Blaze Plan (Pay as you go.).**

1. Use the [Actions on Google Console](https://console.actions.google.com) to add a new project with a name of your choosing and click *Create Project*.
1. Scroll down to the *More Options* section, and click on the *Conversational* card.
1. On the left navigation menu under *BUILD*, click on *Actions*. Click on *Add Your First Action* and choose your app's language(s).
1. Select *Custom intent*, click *BUILD*. This will open a Dialogflow console. Click *CREATE*.
1. Click on the gear icon to see the project settings.
1. Select *Export and Import*.
1. Select *Restore from zip*. Follow the directions to restore from the `agent.zip` file in this repo.
1. Deploy the fulfillment webhook provided in the functions folder using [Google Cloud Functions for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/):
   1. Follow the instructions to [set up and initialize Firebase SDK for Cloud Functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/get-started#set_up_and_initialize_functions_sdk). Make sure to select the project that you have previously generated in the Actions on Google Console and to reply `N` when asked to overwrite existing files by the Firebase CLI.
   1. Run `firebase deploy --only functions` and take note of the endpoint where the fulfillment webhook has been published. It should look like `Function URL (quotes): https://${REGION}-${PROJECT}.cloudfunctions.net/quotes`
1. Go back to the Dialogflow console and select *Fulfillment* from the left navigation menu.
1. Enable *Webhook*, set the value of *URL* to the `Function URL` from the previous step, then click *Save*.
1. Go back to the [Actions on Google console](https://console.actions.google.com) and select the project that you have created for this sample.
1. Type `Talk to my test app` in the simulator, or say `OK Google, talk to my test app` to any Actions on Google enabled device signed into your developer account.
